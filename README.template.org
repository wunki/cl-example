/Simple overview of use and purpose./

** Description

/An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use./

** Getting Started with Emacs

- Load the =.asd= files for both the library and the test by visiting the .asd files and running =C-c C-k=.
- Start the REPL, I'm using Sly.
- Run =(ql:quickload :cl-${PROJECT_NAME})= and =(ql:quickload :cl-${PROJECT_NAME}.test)=. You could also do =(require :cl-${PROJECT_NAME})= but that will not download any required dependencies.
- Happy coding.
