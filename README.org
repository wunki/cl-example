* Common Lisp Example Project

This is the example project that I use for new Common Lisp projects. It's as minimal as possible and will enable you to have both a package for your code and a package for your tests.

** Usage

- Clone the repository.
- Rename the files according to the name of your package. I tend to include =cl= for the system name and remove the =cl= for the package name. E.g. =cl-example= for the system, =example= for the package name.

** Usage in Emacs

- Load the =.asd= files for both packages by visiting them and pressing =C-c C-k=.
- Start the REPL, I'm using Sly.
- Run =(ql:quickload :cl-example)= and =(ql:quickload :cl-example.test)=. You could also do =(require :cl-example)= but that will not download any required dependencies.
- That's it!
