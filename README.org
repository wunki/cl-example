* Common Lisp Example Project

This is the example project that I use for new Common Lisp projects. It's as minimal as possible and will enable you to have both a package for your code and a package for your tests.

** Usage

- Clone this repository.
- Run the =setup.sh= script with =./setup.sh=. This will ask you for your new project name and set up all the files for you. Make sure you supply your name without the =cl-= prefix. In the end, it will also ask you if you want a fresh Git repository.

** Usage in Emacs

- Load the =.asd= files for both packages by visiting them and pressing =C-c C-k=.
- Start the REPL, I'm using Sly.
- Run =(ql:quickload :cl-example)= and =(ql:quickload :cl-example.test)=. You could also do =(require :cl-example)= but that will not download any required dependencies.
- That's it!

The example project is based on the projects from [[https://github.com/sjl][Steve Losh]].
